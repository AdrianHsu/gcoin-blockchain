## Definition
### Smart Contract
Smart Contracts are programs that formally encode certain conditions and outcomes. The code is agreed upon by the contracting parties in advance and must be faithfully executed by a disinterested, neutral system.
### Oracle
Some smart contracts systems, including the one built into Bitcoin, are strictly deterministic. In order to interact with the real world, these systems rely on cryptographic signatures submitted by outside systems called "oracles."

Oracles are trusted entities which sign claims about the state of the world. Since the verification of signatures can be done deterministically, it allows deterministic smart contracts to react to the (non-deterministic) outside world.
